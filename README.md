### This project contains analysis of a coffee shop and provide a machine learning model which can predict price of coffee based on learned feature.
### This project is one of the project from the Data Analyst internship provided by Unified Mentor.

### üìä Data Analysis

In this project, various types of data analysis were performed using Python, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis:
* Univariate Analysis: Focused on individual variables using visualizations such as histograms, line plots, box plots, and pie charts.
* Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between two variables using scatter plots and bar plots.
* Multivariate Analysis: Analyzed interactions among multiple variables using heatmaps and pair plots.

### üìÅ Dataset

**Dataset Link:** [Click here to view the dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YqP5Na7_o2xBwsFcf-0NTK31u5_EpxKC/view)

**Dataset Description:**

This dataset captures transaction data from a coffee shop. It includes details such as:

- Date and time of each transaction  
- Payment method (specifically card-based payments) & Encrypted (Dummy) Card details
- Transaction amount  
- Type of coffee sold  

Each row represents a unique transaction, with customers identified by a unique card number. The dataset enables exploration of:

- Customer preferences  
- Sales trends over time  
- Popularity of various coffee types (e.g., Latte, Hot Chocolate, Americano, etc.)

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Model

A **Linear Regression** model was used to predict the transaction amount (`money`) based on the following features:

- `coffee_name`: Type of coffee sold  
- `cash_type`: Mode of payment  
- `hour`: Hour of the transaction  
- `day_of_week`: Day on which the transaction occurred

**Model Performance:**

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 1.84  
- **R¬≤ Score:** 0.82  

These results indicate that the model explains approximately 82% of the variance in transaction amounts, suggesting a good fit for the data.

### üñºÔ∏è Visualization Output - 5-in-1 Plot

A dashboard-style visualization was created to provide a comprehensive overview of the coffee shop's sales data. It includes the following five plots:

1. **Total Revenue by Coffee Type** (Bar Plot)  
2. **Most Popular Coffee by Count** (Bar Plot)  
3. **Revenue by Payment Type** (Pie Chart)  
4. **Revenue by Day of the Week** (Bar Plot)  
5. **Revenue by Hour of the Day** (Line Plot)

These plots were combined into a single figure for better visual insight.
